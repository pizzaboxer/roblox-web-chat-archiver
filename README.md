# Roblox web chat archiver

This is for if you want to preserve and keep access to your old Roblox website chat messages with friends in case you either lose access to your account or want to remove them from your friend list.

It's what I made this for, as I wanted to preserve my old chat histories while also wanting to clean up my friend list, as you lose access to chat history with someone when you unfriend them.

To archive your chat history, run `app.py`. It will ask you for a .ROBLOSECURITY cookie token, and then generate a archive file in the folder.

To review your chat history, open `viewer.html` and load the archive file that was generated earlier.
